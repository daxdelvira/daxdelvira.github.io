## About Me

{% capture text %}

I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, where I'm advised by [Anand Iyer](https://www.anand-iyer.com/) in the NetSys Lab. My research interests lie at the intersection of systems and machine learning, with a current focus on building efficient and reliable agentic LLM systems for complex, distributed tasks.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I was an undergraduate research intern on several systems projects. At Carnegie Mellonâ€™s Parallel Data Lab, I worked with [Greg Ganger](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/ganger-greg.html) and [Rashmi Vinayak](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rvinayak/) on a theory-enhanced system for efficiently transitioning data across redundancy schemes. At Microsoft Research, I collaborated with Sid Sen, Chetan Bansal, and Gagan Somashekar to develop synthetic application request traces via AI behavior mimicry for system reliability testing.

I always enjoy learning from other students and researchers, and can be reached by emailing dax [at] gatech [dot] edu.
