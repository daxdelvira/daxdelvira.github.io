I'm grateful to work with a fantastic advisor and labmates. We each explore the intersections of ML, networks, and systems from different angles. More on my labmates work can be found on their respective sites:
 + [Vima Gupta](https://vimagupta.github.io/) (Systems optimizations for mixture-of-experts models)
 + [Mingyu Guan](https://mingyuguan.github.io/) (Graph neural networks and DNN Inference)
 + [Jiaqi Deng](https://jqdeng7.github.io/) (Multimodal models)
 + Abhishek Vijeev (Model merging)
 + Kartik Sinha (RAGs)

Diversifying CS Research and systems research specifically is important to me. If you're a woman considering undertaking computer science research in undergrad, or already know you want to pursue a PhD, and need help writing statements, finding REU programs, building skillsets or have questions about how to get started, please email me. You have what it takes and there are plenty of people who want to support you--we were in your shoes a short while ago!
